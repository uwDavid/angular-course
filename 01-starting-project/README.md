# Angular Tutorial Part #1

This To-Do Application project demonstrates common concepts used in Angular:

- Components
- Template components
- Component Input
- Component Events, Event Listeners
- Data Pipes
- Directives (ng-content)
- FormModule

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
